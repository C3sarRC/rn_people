# App

This is a test application for react native
that uses https://randomuser.me/documentation api
it is impossible to have a better pagination since the api does not offer it, same thing happens with the sorting feature because it does not have, also because the api is unable to return the full count of result, is impossible to paginate by numbers.

another apporach we could take is to ask for the full result set and then take care of it locally, a module was already added to specify only the fields we want to pull in src/services/randomUser.js

Presentar una tabla de items que contenga los datos
obtenidos de https://randomuser.me/
